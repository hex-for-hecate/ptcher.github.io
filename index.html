<h3>[Master's Thesis]</h3>
<p>
On April 25, 2016, I defened my master's thesis. Its title is 
"Transclusion In Software for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate".

This version was lightly revised after my defense. Compared with the official
thesis archived by Aarhus University, it is missing some typos and typographical
errors. If you spot other errors, or want to talk about my thesis, feel free to
send me an e-mail.
